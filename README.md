# Brain Damage Patient Database (BDPDB)
BDPDB is a browser-based application for managing, browsing, and searching demographic information and neuroimaging data from patients with brain injury. This application is intended for use by researchers working with fully anonymized data, and **is not designed for use in clinical settings**. Database access can be limited to authorized users.

## This is a work in progress, and BDPDB should be considered pre-alpha software.
Functionality may change, dissapear, or temporarily cease to function as development continues.
